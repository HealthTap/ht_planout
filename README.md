Full Ruby port of Facebook's experimentation framework [PlanOut](https://github.com/jerry-uejio/ht_planout)

Line by line port of everything except for namespaces, as the implementation is database specific

```ruby
gem 'ht_planout'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ht_planout
